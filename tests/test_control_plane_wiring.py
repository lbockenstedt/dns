"""Standalone entrypoint wiring.

REGRESSION (review #3): ``DNSSpoke``'s cluster transport resolves its control
plane through ``self.control_plane``, and the plane consults the module's
``cluster_listener_required()`` the moment it is registered. Registering first
left a window in which the module was live on the hub connection but had no
plane to reach its workers through — every worker RPC in that window failed
with "no control plane attached".
